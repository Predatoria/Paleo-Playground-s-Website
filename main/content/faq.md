**What is Beasts of Bermuda?**

Beasts of Bermuda is an open-world, multiplayer survival game in which the player plays as different creatures such as Dinosaurs from the Mesozoic Era.  The game will offer several different game modes that challenge the player in different ways once it is completed.

**What different game modes will be in Beasts of Bermuda?**

Currently our game only has one mode of play, Free Roam.  In this mode, the player can select any creature to play as without cost or punishment for death.  We've been discussing additional game modes due to interest and feedback amongst our community ,and we have a few ideas we would like to implement.

1.  Life-cycle based leveling in which the player starts as a juvenile of any species they wish and continues to grow, becoming more powerful over time in a multiplayer environment.  This mode would likely be coupled with a talent or skillpoint-based system, in which the player becomes more powerful in ways they can choose.

2.  Merit-based system in which the player earns the right to play increasingly powerful creatures by earning survival points.  Well-fed, hydrated, and comfortable creatures gain survival points much more rapidly in such a system.

3.  Combat-based system in which a player must successfully hunt and kill other players in order to gain the right to play larger and more powerful creatures.   Here, risk vs reward will very much be a factor as the larger the foe you down, the more reward you will gain.

**Where is Beasts of Bermuda in its development?**

Beasts of Bermuda began development on January 16th, 2017.  Currently, the game offers a fully functional game world with many combat mechanics and map-based survival elements already in place.  Future development will likely focus on expanding our playable creature roster, improving the quality of our graphics, models, and general assets, and then implementing additional game modes beyond Free Roam.

**What creatures are planned to be playable?**

Currently, one can play as the following creatures in Beasts of Bermuda:

* Acrocanthosaurus
* Apatosaurus
* Elasmosaurus
* Ichthyovenator
* Megalosaurus
* Mosasaurus
* Pachycephalosaurus
* Parasaurolophus
* Pteranodon
* Utahraptor
* Velociraptor

It is likely the following creatures will be playable due to our interest in expanding the niches available to players in Beasts of Bermuda.  Many of these animals are selected due to their unique niches or ability to utilize certain gameplay mechanics.  Many are piscivores, aquatics, flying creatures, or semiaquatic animals.

* Deinosuchus, Sarcosuchus, or another large Crocodilian 
* Thalassodromaeous, or another large, crested Pterosaur
* Austroraptor, or another piscivorous Dromaeosaurid
* A member of Ichthyosauria
* Lurdusaurus, or another semiaquatic Hadrosaur

**What is unique about Beasts of Bermuda?**

Beasts of Bermuda offers the experience of playing in unique niches as aquatic, flight-based, or terrestrial creatures.  Piscivores offer a different lifestyle to traditional carnivores, the creatures of which are often very adept at swimming, even if also quite capable on land.

It also offers unique map elements.  Whether you're exploring a cave while taking shelter from a storm, watching the tide drop to safely cross to a new island, or migrating to avoid a forest fire or depleted watering hole, the map is always changing and the world is alive. 

The playable creatures in Beasts of Bermuda all have unique abilities that differentiate them from others.  Some can grab, others can pounce and latch.  Some can sense a weak opponent or warn a herd of a lurking predator, and others can climb to escape danger.  Every animal is different in Beasts of Bermuda, very much so, and a lot of effort has been put in to ensure every creature added fulfils a unique niche.

A unique resource in the form of comfort offers a totally new way to design mechanics and shape gameplay.  Carnivores in close proximity to herbivores will stress each other out, resulting in various gameplay disadvantages or even death should the stress become extreme.  Carnivores are only comforted by their own kind, becoming stressed in the prolonged presence of different species.  Map elements, in particular storms and massive storm surges, will also cause stress.  Maintaining a low level of stress (we call it comfort) is a major aspect of survival in Beasts of Bermuda.

**Why does Beasts of Bermuda need a Kickstarter?**

Beasts of Bermuda needs funds to commission and contract professional artists for services related to modeling, animating, sound creation, and skin design.  Up until this point, it has been developed under a very, very low budget by a couple broke indie devs.  This is something we very much wish to change via Kickstarter.

**Will Beasts of Bermuda have singleplayer support, or will it strictly be a multiplayer game?**

Beasts of Bermuda is being created as a multiplayer game and multiplayer play is strongly encouraged.  

**What platforms will Beasts of Bermuda be available on?**

Currently, Beasts of Bermuda only has Windows support as adding support for other operating systems is low on our priority list.  In the future, MAC and Linux support will be added as well.  Steam will be our method of distribution.  Beasts of Bermuda is a PC game and will not function on consoles.

**When will Beasts of Bermuda be released?**

Beasts of Bermuda will enter Steam Early Access when it is ready to do so.  We cannot give an ETA on when Beasts of Bermuda will be released yet.

**Will there be Steam achievements?**

Yes!  I absolutely plan for achievements to be part of the game!

**How much will Beasts of Bermuda Cost?**

Beasts of Bermuda will very likely cost $20.00 and will be purchased on Steam.

**How can I keep up with Beasts of Bermuda's development?**

The best way to keep up with development is to join our Discord, as sometimes I get lazy and don't update the website regularly.  Currently, most activity takes place here including links to our most recent test builds and patch notes.
