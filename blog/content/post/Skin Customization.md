I want to write a bit today about the skin customization system we have planned for Paleo Playground.  For a bit of background, I was very impressed with a website known as Evosaur that allows players to create a wide array of different dinosaur skins simply by choosing colors and patterns with dropdown menus.  In great part, this is the source of inspiration for the system we are implementing here.

We want players to be able to have a great degree of control over the skins they use in-game rather than simply have a selection of few premade, static skin choices.  One aspect thatâ€™s appealing about this system is that it lets each player have a unique look, as the possibilities will be nearly infinite once the system is complete.  A player can become known and recognized for their unique look and create an in-game identity using such a system.  We also have further plans for implementing this system as a means of cosmetic-based progression, which I will get into later on in this post.

The UI for the skin customization system is now complete and here is a picture!  This is actually a skin created by That Thing specifically for use in our skin customization system.  A word of caution, however, is that in the future there will be many more options available to players than simply what is shown on this screenshot.  This system really is in its infancy, and we currently lack art assets to fully implement the complete selection of options that will be available at this time.
