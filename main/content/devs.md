Paleo Playground is being primarily co-developed by both Predatoria and Vipe.


[Predatoria](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/ "Predatoria's Steam page") is... oh hey, that's me!  I should talk in first-person here.

[Vipe](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vipe_lc_cfx/ "Vipe's Steam page") is an aspiring digital artist with a passion for paleontology and dinosaurs, and has done some wonderful [art](http://thy-vipe.deviantart.com/ "Vipe's Deviantart").  He's a veteran player of Primal Carnage (Original) and has a particular liking for playing the Pteranodon.  Needless to say, he can't wait to implement our Pteranodon into Paleo Playground!  He's also the owner and admin of the PC server [_Get your Claws and Guns out!_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owuv0oIPO-FXLJcQUBbB0pGlxQr9_Qjbntt2IuhHBjE/edit "Server Info").
