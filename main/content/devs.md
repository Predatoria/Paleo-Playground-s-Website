Paleo Playground is being primarily co-developed by both Predatoria and Vipe, two players who really just love gaming so much that we've set off on a journey to create our own world in which to play in the game of our dreams.

[Predatoria](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/ "Predatoria's Steam page") is... oh hey, that's me!  I should talk in first-person here.  I was a long-time veteran carno player on [The Isle](http://store.steampowered.com/app/376210/ "The Isle's Steam Page") and in great part, my great experiences in this game sparked the idea for me to become the founder of Paleo Playground.  I don't have any fancy credentials.  I've just always been a gamer who, in particular, loves PvP and loves a good fight.  You can see some of my antics [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYBMJFBBYgMOLPystoqMyA "Predatoria's Youtube Channel").

[Vipe](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vipe_lc_cfx/ "Vipe's Steam page") is an aspiring digital artist with a passion for paleontology and dinosaurs, and has done some wonderful [art](http://thy-vipe.deviantart.com/ "Vipe's Deviantart").  He's a veteran player of Primal Carnage (Original) and has a particular liking for playing the Pteranodon.  Needless to say, he can't wait to implement our Pteranodon into Paleo Playground!  He's also the owner and admin of the PC server [_Get your Claws and Guns out!_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owuv0oIPO-FXLJcQUBbB0pGlxQr9_Qjbntt2IuhHBjE/edit "Server Info").

We aren't alone on this endeavor, however.  Many people have stepped up and helped us greatly along our journey to create Paleo Playground.  I'd like to give a
