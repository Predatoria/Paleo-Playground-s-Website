Beasts of Bermuda is being primarily co-developed by both Predatoria and Vipe, two players who really just love gaming so much that we've set off on a journey to create our own world in which to play in the game of our dreams.

[Predatoria](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/ "Predatoria's Steam page") is... oh hey, that's me!  I should talk in first-person here.  I was a long-time veteran carno player on [The Isle](http://store.steampowered.com/app/376210/ "The Isle's Steam Page") and in great part, my great experiences in this game sparked the idea for me to become the founder of Beasts of Bermuda.  I don't have any fancy credentials.  I've just always been a gamer who, in particular, loves PvP and loves a good fight.  You can see some of my antics [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYBMJFBBYgMOLPystoqMyA "Predatoria's Youtube Channel").

[Vipe](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vipe_lc_cfx/ "Vipe's Steam page") is an aspiring digital artist with a passion for paleontology and dinosaurs, and has done some wonderful [art](http://thy-vipe.deviantart.com/ "Vipe's Deviantart").  He's a veteran player of Primal Carnage (Original) and has a particular liking for playing the Pteranodon.  Needless to say, he can't wait to implement our Pteranodon into Beasts of Bermuda!  He's also the owner and admin of the PC server [_Get your Claws and Guns out!_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owuv0oIPO-FXLJcQUBbB0pGlxQr9_Qjbntt2IuhHBjE/edit "Server Info").

We aren't alone on this endeavor, however.  Many people have stepped up and helped us greatly along our journey to create Beasts of Bermuda.  I'd like to give a
