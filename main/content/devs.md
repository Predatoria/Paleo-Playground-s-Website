Paleo Playground is being primarily co-developed by both Predatoria and Vipe, two players who really just love gaming so much that we've set off on a journey to create our own world in which to play in the game of our dreams.

[Predatoria](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatoria/ "Predatoria's Steam page") is... oh hey, that's me!  I should talk in first-person here.
