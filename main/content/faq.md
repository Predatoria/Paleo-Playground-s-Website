# Questions
------
**What creatures are planned to be playable?**

Given how young Paleo Playground is, the topic of finding models for use in our game was a tough one.  We don't yet have any money for professional commissions so asset stores for UE4 or Unity have been a frequent place we've visited in search of models and other assets.

That being said, finding obscure or under-represented dinosaurs that come with a good set of animations on these asset stores is not a possibility for us at this time.  

In the future, it is one of our goals to commission professionally done models of a wide variety, the creatures of which will likely based to some extent on popular demand.  For now, however, we have acquired models and accompanying animations for the following creatures, and have full intention of implementing all fourteen of these terrestrial, aquatic, and flying creatures into our game as a minimum.

* Ankylosaurus - Planned
* Apatosaurus - Planned
* Compsognathus - Planned
* Elasmosaurus - Planned
* Gallimimus - Planned
* Mosasaurus - Planned
* Pachycephalosaurus - Planned
* Parasaurolophus - Ingame
* Pteranodon - Planned
* Stegosaurus - Planned
* Triceratops - Planned
* Tyrannosaurus -Planned
* Utahraptor - Ingame, but model is being replaced
* Velociraptor - Ingame

**What kinds of maps will there be?**

I've always been a fan of bright, sunny, tropical maps and I also like islands and jungle ruins.  

**What survival elements will be present in Paleo Playground?**

Players will need to manage three resources well in order to survive in our ecosystem.  Two of these, food and water, are easily guessable by an audience well-versed in survival games, but the third may come as an interesting surprise.  The third resource that will play a very critical role in a player’s ability to hunt, evade predation, and ultimately survive is comfort.  I’ll go into a bit more detail regarding the roles food, water, and comfort will play in a player’s survival in Paleo Playground.

Food will be acquired in one of two ways, depending on which creature you choose to play.  Carnivores will survive solely by feasting upon the corpses of others.  Herbivores will survive solely by feasting upon plant life that’s placed around the map.  Omnivores will survive by eating from both sources, but will only be able to fully satiate their hunger by feeding on both sources of food.

Larger creature carcasses yield more food value, and larger creatures also require more food to sustain themselves.  This is, in fact, one way we will balance the ecosystem for meat-eaters.  Smaller creatures will simply have an easier time feeding.  The AI in our game will be small, offering less than a bite to a large carnivore.  This means that while a smaller creature such as a Compsognathus may be able to survive solely off the pickings of our AI or a quick snack from a nearby carcass, a larger creature will need to hunt and kill other players to survive.  If everybody wishes to play a Tyrannosaurus Rex, they’ll need to kill each other for survival, as the baseline ecosystem will fail to offer food for such a collection of large beasts.

Regarding plant material, it works in a similar way.  Large herbivores will require a lot of plants to survive, larger ones being capable of consuming entire areas of plant material at once.  Different herbivores will also eat from different plant groups, with larger ones being capable of eating larger foliage.  The plant life on the map will be tuned such that it poses threat of exhaustion should too many players play as large herbivores.  Plants will regenerate over time, and this foliage regeneration rate is fixed.  A player may find themselves much more relaxed regarding dietary requirements playing a smaller herbivore capable of sustaining itself purely on smaller, quickly respawning plants.

We also have an interesting take on how water works in Paleo Playground.  Our water sources are not static.  They deplete and the water table drops when used for drinking, and it slowly replenish over time.  Larger creatures deplete water rapidly, whereas smaller creatures do little to drop the level of a watering hole.  Again this offers a second check on our ecosystem in Paleo Playground.  If every player wishes to play a large herbivore or carnivore, they’re going to be thirsty and watering holes will dry up, forcing competition.

Lastly, the resource that may play the most pivotal role in shaping the player-built ecosystems Paleo Playground will harbor is comfort.  Comfort is a representation of how comfortable you are as a creature in the world.  Stressful scenarios will decrease your comfort, whereas scenarios that provide safety or soothing will yield an increase in comfort.
