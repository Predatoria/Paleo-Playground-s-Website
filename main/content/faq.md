**What is Beasts of Bermuda?**

Beasts of Bermuda is the beginning of an open-world, multiplayer-based, Mesozoic ecosystem where players can take the role of several creatures of their choice and attempt to survive.  The ecosystem will be comprised primarily of players, though smaller, AI-based prey will also serve some sustenance.  

**Where is Beasts of Bermuda in its development?**

Beasts of Bermuda is still very early into its development, which began on January 16th, 2017.  Two months in, however, we're quite proud of what we have to show so far.  

**What creatures are planned to be playable?**

We currently plan to implement the following list of prehistoric creatures.  In the future, this list is likely to expand.

* Acrocanthosaurus - Ingame
* Ankylosaurus - Planned
* Apatosaurus - Planned
* Compsognathus - Planned
* Elasmosaurus - Planned
* Gallimimus - Planned
* Mosasaurus - Planned
* Pachycephalosaurus - Planned
* Parasaurolophus - Ingame
* Pteranodon - Planned
* Stegosaurus - Planned
* Triceratops - Planned
* Tyrannosaurus -Planned
* Utahraptor - Ingame, but model is being replaced
* Velociraptor - Ingame

**Will Beasts of Bermuda have singleplayer support, or will it strictly be a multiplayer game?**

Beasts of Bermuda is being created as a multiplayer game.  We will, however, allow players to host unlisted servers if they desire such that they're effectively solo.

**What platforms will Beasts of Bermuda be available on?**

Currently while Beasts of Bermuda is in its earliest stages of development, it will only have Windows support.  In the future, MAC support will be added as well.  Steam is our target platform for distribution, but we're a bit early in development to be considering Steam Greenlight yet.  We'll get there.

**When will Beasts of Bermuda be released?**

Truth be told, we aren't sure yet.  Development began on Beasts of Bermuda on January 16th, 2017, so as I am writing this the game is about 2 months old.  

**Will there be Steam achievements?**

Yes!  I absolutely plan for achievements to be part of the game!

**How much will Beasts of Bermuda Cost?**

A price has not yet been decided, but it'll likely be $20-25 on Steam when we feel it's ready to go into Steam-based early access development.

**How can I keep up with Beasts of Bermuda's development?**

The best way to keep up with development is to join our Discord or check the development blog located on this webpage.  Currently, most activity takes place here including links to our most recent test builds and patch notes.
